Lenny Erwine's .NET 4.0 Toolkit Library
==========
This project contains sample code for .NET 4.0, which can be re-used.

Code which is specific to particular frameworks, such as web apps or Windows Presentation Foundation should be placed in their own projects.

Likewise, the following should go into their own projects as well:
	- Code which deals with specialized tasks, such as image processing.
	- Code which is complex and would introduce assembly dependencies that might conflict with other more agnostic code.
