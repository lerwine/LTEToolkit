A Simple - Yet Quite Powerful - Palette Quantizer Library
=========================================================
Converted to a class library by Leonard T. Erwine, October, 2014.

This contains source code which was taken from a Code Project Article and Modified as a class library.
A bug was discovered in the Octre quantizer, which I fixed using locking and thread-safe collections from the LTEToolkitLibrary C# project.
