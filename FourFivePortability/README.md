FourFive Portability Project
============================
The purpose of this project is to provide more common interfaces as well as classes which emulate objects
and functionality that exists in .NET 4.5, but not in .NET 4.0.

This can assist both with maintaining legacy apps, making it easier introduce code snippets written in .NET 4.5, as well.

This can also help prepare portions of legacy code to be updated to .NET 4.5.
